# Docker-Project
In this project I have made a TUI(Terminal User Interface) from which user can interact and can run docker services without worrying about 
the commands.I have added the docker compose for setting the complete environment of wordpress that you can get in your system also by 
selecting it from the menu.Also I have included the container for httpd server for hosting your sites and also added ngrok so user can get 
the public IP for hosting. 
For working you can look the screenshots.
This project I have made on RHEL8 using docker.

This project is a part of my docker training which I have done under the guidance of Vimal Daga sir.During this training I have learnt almost 
all the usecases of docker technology. Thanks to Vimal sir for his guidance and fabulous teaching.
